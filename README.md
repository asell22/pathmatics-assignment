## To Run Locally
1. Have node.js installed on your machine - preferably v13.8.0 ( I have not tested if this breaks with earlier versions of node )

1. Once you're in project directory, run **npm i**. This will install dependencies.

1. **npm start** - This will run the server locally on your machine. The local server is running on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.
